- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)**: Statistical data visualization built on top of Matplotlib.
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)**: Interactive graphing library that makes data visualizations web-compatible.

## Web Frameworks

### API
- **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)**: Lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs to interact with data and provide backend functionality.

### Dashboard
- **[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)**: Framework for building interactive, web-based visualizations, ideal for displaying analysis results and data insights.

### Database
- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)** or **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** (optional): Used for storing analyzed data, depending on the project requirements.

### Data Sources
- **[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/)**: Provides real-time tweet data for analysis and trend tracking.

### Containerization
- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: For containerizing the application, enabling easy deployment and consistent environment setup.

### Version Control
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**: For code versioning, collaboration, and repository management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your device:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment, optional)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VivekkumarChauhan/SentimentInsight.git
cd SentimentInsight
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Use the `requirements.txt` file to install necessary packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Step 3: Set Up Configuration

1. **Add your Twitter API credentials**:
   - Open the `config/credentials.py` file.
   - Insert your Twitter API credentials (consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret) as follows:

   ```python
   # config/credentials.py

   # Twitter API credentials
   TWITTER_API_KEY = 'your_consumer_key'
   TWITTER_API_SECRET = 'your_consumer_secret'
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your_access_token_secret'



2. **Open the `config/settings.py` file.**

3. **Modify any project-specific settings as needed.** This may include configurations such as environment variables, database settings, or API endpoints. Here’s an example of what the settings file might look like:

   ```python
   # config/settings.py

   # Example settings
   DEBUG = True
   DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///your_database.db'


## Step 4: Run Data Collection and Model Training (Optional)

1. **Gather Data from Twitter**:
   - Use the Jupyter Notebook located at `notebooks/data_collection.ipynb` to collect data from Twitter.

2. **Preprocess Data and Train the Sentiment Model**:
   - After collecting the data, use the following notebooks for further processing:
     - `notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Preprocess the collected data to prepare it for model training.
     - `notebooks/model_training.ipynb`: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data.

Make sure to follow the instructions in each notebook to ensure successful execution of data collection and model training.

## Step 5: Run the Application

Run the Flask API and Dash Dashboard for predictions and visualizations. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Start the Flask API
python app/api.py

# Start the Dash Dashboard
python app/dashboard.py
```
## Step 5: Run the Application

Run the Flask API and Dash Dashboard for predictions and visualizations. Use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Start the Flask API
python app/api.py

# Start the Dash Dashboard
python app/dashboard.py
```
## Step 6: Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to access the **SentimentInsight** dashboard.
## Usage

- Use the dashboard to input search terms or hashtags to analyze public sentiment.
- Explore real-time visualizations of sentiment analysis to gain insights into public opinions and trends.
## Docker Deployment

To deploy the application using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t sentimentinsight .
2.  **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 sentimentinsight
   ```
This command will run the container and map port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on your host machine, allowing you to access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
